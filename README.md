# How to host a rasa chatbot using NGINX on a linux machine from scratch

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>RASA</h3>
<p>Rasa is an Open Source is a machine learning framework to automate text- and voice-based assistants. We have used rasa to build a conversational chatbot.</p>

<h3>NGINX </h3>
<p>A Nginx HTTPS reverse proxy is an intermediary proxy service which takes a client request, passes it on to one or more servers, and subsequently delivers the server's response back to the client. We are using NGINX here to host the application.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Installing RASA on a the machine</h3>
To install rasa, we have to give the following commands. 

<b>Step 1: Install python3.6 </b>
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
</pre>

<b>Step 2: Install the required development tools</b>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libffi-dev
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
</pre>

<b>Step 3: Create a virtual environment </b><br>We must create a virtual environment where the nlu and core of rasa will be installed. To create the virtual environment we have to give the following command:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install -y python3.6-venv
</pre>

<b> Step 4: Now we have to create a directory where we are going to make our virtual environment. Let's name it chatBot and set up a virtual environment there named "rasaChatBot" </b>
<pre>
mkdir chatBot
cd chatBot
python3.6 -m venv rasaChatBot
</pre>

<b> Now we have to activate the virtual environment by the following command: </b>
<pre>
. rasaChatBot/bin/activate
</pre>

<b> Now that we have our virtual environment set perfectly, we will start installing packages.</br>
Step 5: Install RASA NLU </b>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev
pip install twisted
pip install rasa_nlu
</pre>

If you find the following error:<br>
<pre>
<span style="color:red"> Error: Failed building wheel for simplejson </span></pre> <br>
Then the following command solves the error:
<pre>
<span style="color:blue">pip3 install "/the/file_path/to/wheel-0.32.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl‚Äù
pip3 install wheel</span> </pre>

<b> Step 6: Install spacy pipeline </b>
<pre>
pip install rasa_nlu[spacy]
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
python -m spacy link en_core_web_md en
</pre>

<b> Step 7: Install tensorflow pipeline </b>
<pre>
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install tensorflow==1.15.0
</pre>

<b> Step 8: Install rasa core </b>
<pre>
pip install rasa_core
</pre>
<b> Step 9: Install rasa  </b>
<pre>
pip install rasa
</pre>

Now we have a perfect environment for rasa. We have to move to the next part to install nginx and host the application on nginx

<h3>Part 2: Installing NGINX</h3>
<b> Step 1: Install Nginx with the following command:</b>
<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
</pre>

<b> Step 2: Allow nginx</b>
<pre>
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo ufw status
</pre>

<b> Step 3: start nginx with the following command: </b>
<pre>
sudo systemctl start nginx
</pre>
 
Now open the configuration file of nginx with:
<pre>
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
</pre>

and make the following changes:
<pre>
server_name  [your server ip];
root /data/myChatBotWeb;
</pre>
The server name must be your ip address which you can check by giving the following command:
<pre> ifconfig</pre>
And the root folder is the path where your application, which  you want to host, is.
This root folder should be accessible. It's safe to make a new directory with permission and keep your application there. 
<pre>
sudo mkdir /data
</pre>
And then copy your web application directory in that directory with:
<pre>
sudo cp -r /your/path/to/application /data/myChatBotWeb
</pre>
Now, if you start nginx with :
<pre>
sudo systemctl restart nginx
</pre>And hit your ip address from a browser you should be able to see the homepage of your application.

Now that your nginx is running, it's final part to run rasa as a service in the background 
<h3>Running rasa as e service</h3>
As you know, to run a rasa chatbot, we have to run two things. rasa action server and rasa ui. So we have to make two shell scripts and run these two scripts from two separate services.
<br>
First, we are going to create a script to run the action server. Open the script file with:
<pre>
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/action.sh
</pre>
Add there the following lines:
<pre>
cd /data/rasabot; 															//path where the chatbot is
. /your/path/to/th/virtual/environment/bin/activate							//activate environment
rasa run actions															//run action server
</pre>

Next, we need to create a script to run the ui. Open the script file with:
<pre>
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/runUi.sh
</pre>
<pre>
cd /data/rasabot; 																		//path where the chatbot is
. /your/path/to/th/virtual/environment/bin/activate											//activate environment
python -m rasa run --m ./models --endpoints endpoints.yml --port 5005 -vv --enable-api --cors "*"     //run rasa ui
</pre>

Now, you have to create to services to run two script files.
To create service for action, give the following command:
<pre>
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/botAction.service 
</pre>
And add the following lines:
<pre>
[Unit]
Description=chatbot demo service
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RemainAfterExit=yes
RestartSec=1
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/action.sh
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

</pre>

Next, we need to make the service file for UI by giving the following command:

<pre>
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/botUI.service 
</pre>
And add the following lines:
<pre>
[Unit]
Description=chatbot demo service
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RemainAfterExit=yes
RestartSec=1
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/runUi.sh
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</pre>
Now you have to enable and start the services with the following commands:
<pre>
sudo systemctl enable botAction
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl restart botAction
sudo systemctl status botAction


sudo systemctl enable botUI
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl restart botUI
sudo systemctl status botUI
</pre>
now restart nginx, hope your application is successfully hosted:
<pre>
susdo systemctl restart nginx</pre>
